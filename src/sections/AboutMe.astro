            <h3>Experience</h3>
            <p>
                My journey as a developer began in 2021, working on web and
                mobile applications, along with backend optimizations and
                endpoint development, as well as designing and optimizing NoSQL
                and SQL databases.Currently, I have 3 years of experience
                specializing in eCommerce and CMS platforms. I am committed to
                delivering professional results, meeting deadlines, and making
                key decisions to provide the best solutions for my clients.

            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            <p>
                I am passionate about technology and video games. My interest
                began at the age of 16 through tech-focused channels on the
                internet. My first projects included basic HTML mockups and
                simple JavaScript interactions.

            <h3>Future Goals</h3>
            <p>
                I aim to continue growing as a developer, deepening my expertise
                in eCommerce and CMS platforms, particularly in Shopify. My
                focus is on mastering advanced customizations, optimizing
                performance, and leveraging emerging technologies to provide
                innovative solutions. Additionally, I plan to strengthen my
                technical English skills and expand my capabilities in technical
                interviews and collaboration on international projects.
